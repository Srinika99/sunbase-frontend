# React Web App

## Installing
Use the following instructions
1. Clone the repositories
2. Install npm
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run the web server `npm run start`

## Built Using
1. React and Redux
2. Tailwind
3. Axios

### Challenges I faced
1. The web-server was blocked by CORS, had to manually verify each API request
2. Another workaround could be using CORS chrome extension, however, it doesn't work completely.

### Improvements
Since the application was developed in a limited time, it can be improved on the following
1. The navigation is not smooth within the application
2. Lack of error handling
3. Alerts and messages are absent
